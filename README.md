# #SN-MLTB # Fully Based On #WZML . 

Base Repo : https://github.com/weebzone/WZML

# Use this template option available on Puffin Browser. To fork as private repo use Puffin Browser

# Fork or import heroku branch only . If you already fork both branch then delete master branch . I wish it will help to protect ban from server .

# Instruction #

Edit Config From Here . Rename sample_config.env to config.env and fill required vars.
Upload token.pickle in root folder.
If you want to add service account json then create a folder name accounts and upload your account json file .

This docker is unable to extract accounts.zip . So create a folder name accounts and upload all service accounts json in accounts folder.
If you add anything in heroku branch you need to run workflow to load changes .

# Torr... and mag.. mirr... with /qb command will down your bot and your account will suspend . So use only /m for torr.. and mag.. . Just remember dont use /qb for anything .
